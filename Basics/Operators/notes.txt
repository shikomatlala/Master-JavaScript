operators:
An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.

Addition operator (+)
===================
* when the datatype is of type string then the addition operator (combines, concatenates) the strings.
* when the datatype is of type number then the addition operator (adds) the numbers
* Returns a value/result


Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (-, *, /)
=======================================
All of these operators only work on numeric values.
-, *, /
* returns a value/result

Assignment operator (=)
==================
This assigns a value to a variable - what I find interesting about this, is we can borrow the knowledge of swift's assignment operators and consider if this operator also returns a value.
* does not return a value/result.

String Equality (===)
========================
* Returns a value
* Performs an operatorion to see if two values are equal - It returns a (boolean) result

Not (!)
===================
* Prefix operator
* Turns a true value into false.


Does Not Equal (!==)
==============
